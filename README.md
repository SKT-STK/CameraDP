datapack for a custom new block/item thatll allow the player to make a map art using it, essentially just an old school camera added to mc,
you can craft like so: (1st row: iron ingot, iron ingot, glass) (2nd row: redstone dust, quartz crystal, observer) (3rd row: any wooden log, armor stand, glass),
its gonna start taking a photo immediately after being placed on the ground (in the direction in which the placer was looking),
after its done taking the photo (around a minute) itll play a sound,
after said sound, you can right click on it with a canvas (crafted like a painting, but with a brush instead of a wool in the middle),
after that you will be holding an blank picture thats gonna need right-clicking,
if all goes well youll be teleported back to the camera with a done picture in you inventory,

!!!IMPORTANT!!! THIS DATAPACK HAS A CORRESPONDING RESOURCEPACK (CameraRP)
